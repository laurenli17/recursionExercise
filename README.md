# recursionExercise
I found out I am not very good at using recursion when studying Software 1 at university, so I found some recursion exercises and take notes here for attentions and mistakes.
The coding exercise website is [here](https://codingbat.com/java).

1. BunnyEars 

Do not using loops & multiplication: Then using **ADD**!

2. sumDigits

Think what is the correct base case and other odinary cases. 

(In this case, the base case is n only have one digit which is n **/** 10 == 0, not %).
